WIP

### [TODO]
- prevent auto video resizing
- stabilize window size accross different platform
- caching video src
- database management page, or
- simple button to delete registered match info
- switch to file based db
- video clipping and exporting (perhaps this is included in db management page, idk)
- show latest tagged event as dot on the pitch (maybe with arrow)
- generate relevant dataviz (maybe, i think this is too much)
- user manual
- updater
